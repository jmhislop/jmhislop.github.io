						<p>I spent a long time during my time at MPA working on content on the topic of mental health. Included
						in this topic, but not exclusively is also the topics of gender identity and other social minorities.
						Here I have collated the collection of resources I found to be very useful on these topics for educational
						purposes. A lot of the mental health advice below is particularly specific to pandemic times and working from
						home, but a lot of the advice still stands and is very relevant considering the current circumstances.</p>
						
						<p>As a discalimer, I am by no means an expert on these topics. But one thing I can say is I have realised
							every single person is very different when it comes to what works for them. These resources I hope can
							be a great starting point for people wanting to learn about these topics, either for themselves or for
							someone else, but nothing can replace professional help. If you or someone you know really needs help
							and/or are in danger, please seek professional help immediately. There are some resources at the bottom
							of this page.
							
						<h2>Respecting identity</h2>
						<p>This is not necessarily a mental health issue, but for a lack of a better place to put this currently, 
							I'd like to include a number of resources here on the topic of respecting identity of our colleagues 
							and friends. The aim here is to provide a surface-level overview of this topic, in the hope that 
							this will increase awareness around this topic such that current and future collaborators and friends 
							will feel welcomed and accepted and their identities will be respected.</p>

						<h3>Helping others with their mental health</h3>
						<h4>Giving and receiving advice</h4>
						<p>Many people have suffered with their mental health lately. It can feel impossible to settle into a routine of working from home and to motivate yourself to do work or even 
							everyday mundane tasks. There has been an increase in sharing our troubles and difficulties which can be very liberating to say these things out loud as well as hearing 
							that other people are going through the same thing. But what often comes from this is an avalanche of ‘advice’. Advice is (almost always) well-meant by a caring friend 
							or a loving family member, but it can do a lot more harm than good in some circumstances. I also want to point out the irony that a lot of ‘advice’ will be presented 
							in this email, but you are free to take whatever serves you and reject what doesn’t work for you. This is not so easy to do when it is directed to you in person however. 
							Here are some articles to consider on giving and receiving advice:</p>

						<h4>Zoom fatigue and remote working</h4>
						<p>We are all used to the constant Zoom calls and the ‘can you see my cursor’, ‘can you hear me’, ‘Oh, you’ve frozen’, etc etc. But Zoom/video calls can be draining, 
							especially for particular personality types. Here are some articles for those who would like to understand more:</p>

						<h4>Redefining 'Self-care'</h4>
						<p>Self-care is not necessarily a bath with candles or going to get a beauty treatment. Self-care should be thought of 
							almost as self-preservation. It can be saying no to things you know will drain you, or starting a bit late one day 
							because you just wanted to take some extra time to make yourself a nice breakfast and enjoy your coffee. What you 
							consider to be ‘self-care’ will be extremely person specific, but I encourage you to spend some time identifying 
							your own versions.</p>

						<h3>Hormones and mental health</h3>
						<p>I wanted to add a section here on hormonal effects on mental health, as it's something that I learnt more about
						recently and I think it's worth mentioning and listing some articles. This is relevant for menstruating individuals.</p>
