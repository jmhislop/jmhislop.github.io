						<h2>About me</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">

						<p>I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Helsinki in Finland. 
							I work on high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies with a focus on the 
							formation and evolution of stellar clusters, nuclear star clusters and black holes.</p>
						
						<p>I previously did my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany under the
							supervision of Thorsten Naab. Before that, I studied MPhys Physics with Astrophysics [Research Placement] 
							at the University of Sussex under the supervision of Professor Peter Thomas. My research interests are 
							predominantly in theoretical astrophysics, particularly galaxy formation and evolution. I also have experience 
							in cosmology, as well as applying machine learning techniques to both cosmology and galaxy evolution. </p>

						<h3>Stuff that's not physics</h3>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						
						<p>When it came to making choices about university, I had two choices: Music or Medicine. I had trained classically 
							in singing and piano from a young age before furthering my studies at Trinity College of Music 
							(Greenwich, London) at the ages of 16-19, as well as studying for my A-levels. My principle study was 
							singing, but I also studied piano, organ, flute and composition. I eventually decided to start my full 
							time studies in Operatic Vocal Studies (second study Pianist) at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland 
							(Glasgow, Scotland). A few months into my studies, however, I began to grow a bit bored of the lack of 
							academia. I started studying mathematics in my bedroom and watched countless documentaries. One thing 
							led to another and precisely 1 year after beginning my opera studies in Glasgow, I began my foundation 
							year in Physics at University of Sussex. I obtained a first class masters degree and am now studying for 
							my PhD. Not sure how I ended up here but I’m pretty happy about it!
							
							I very rarely sing anymore, but I can often be found at the piano. Unfortunately I don’t have any 
							videos of any recent performances (primarily due to a lack of time to do anything other than physics!!) 
							but here are a couple from when I was much younger, before beginning my studies in Glasgow. </p>
